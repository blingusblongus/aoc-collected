Thoughts:
    - I did part one the literal way, but not the clever way - which is probably what's required for part 2. 
    - **Spoilers** we don't actually need to do the array mutation, and doing so doesn't scale - instead, we can just keep track of which indexes require us to add rows when calculating the distance.
