# Advent of Code (Collected)

I love the Advent of code, but often wish I had a better system for organizing them, and comparing the strategies and differences between different languages.
Previously, I used separate repos for each language, and usually started a different year for each language as well.

This repo is an effort to centralize my AoC code so I can compare and learn from the different strategies, improve old solutions with my current knowledge, and implement better testing practices overall.
