# Advent of Code (Collected)

I love the Advent of code, but often wish I had a better system for organizing them, and comparing the strategies and differences between different languages.
Previously, I used separate repos for each language, and usually started a different year for each language as well.

This repo is an effort to centralize my AoC code so I can compare and learn from the different strategies, improve old solutions with my current knowledge, and implement better testing practices overall.

As I review and refactor old solutions, my overall goal is not to code golf, but rather to look for opportunities to write extensible, readable, and reasonably defensive code, as well as try new techniques and strategies.

It's currently a WIP as I migrate my answers in, and doesn't yet contain all my solutions.
